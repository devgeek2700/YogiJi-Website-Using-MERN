# YogiJi-Website-Using-MERN

I have created a yoga website using MERN Stack. This website was created while learning the Basis of MERN Stack.

The frontend is created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and, for backend, I have used NodeJs, ExpressJs and others, more, Dependencies and, for databases, I have used MongoDB.

In this project, I have created a proper Login and Register System and also integrated cookies using a cookie-parser and authenticated users can only visit the main pages on the websites using jsonwebtoken.

I have created password encryption using bcryptjs and for viewing engines I have used hbs.

I have created this yoga website, so that users can practice yoga poses by looking at the videos given on the website.

A yoga website combines convenience, variety, accessibility, learning resources, community, and personalization to enhance the overall yoga experience and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
