# YogiJi-Website-Using-MERN

I have created a yoga website using MERN Stack. This website was created while learning the Basis of MERN Stack.

The frontend is created using Html, Css, Javasrcipt and for backend I have used NodeJs, ExpressJs and other more Dependencies and for Database I have used MongoDB.

A yoga website combines convenience, variety, accessibility, learning resources, community, and personalization to enhance the overall yoga experience and make it more accessible to a wider audience.
